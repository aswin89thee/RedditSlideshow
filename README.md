RedditSlideshow
===============

Another application I wrote for my Raspberry pi based digital picture frame.

RedditSlideshow is an application that goes to a subreddit, pulls the submissions from the front page and displays the images from their links in a slideshow.

I use this application to pull the images from /r/earthporn.

The application prompts for a subreddit name as input if it is not already supplied via command line argument.

As a next step, I want to use a settings.xml file to define some of the parameters of the slideshow like interval between pictures, maximum number of photos to take before starting over again from front page.
